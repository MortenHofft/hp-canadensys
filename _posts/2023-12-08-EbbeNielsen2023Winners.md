Two of the former Canadensys managers are shining in the GBIF community, and continue to use their skills to improve and develop innovative tools.  

[**Peter Desmet**](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8442-8025), who is now working at the [Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO)](https://inbo.be/en/), is part of the winning team of the [2023 Ebbe Nielsen challenge](https://www.gbif.org/ebbe).  
Together with [**Nicolas No√©**](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9503-4750), of [The Binary Forest](https://thebinaryforest.net/), they developed [**GBIF Alert**](https://www.gbif.org/news/EQgUzZ4YA75BSeLs1naI9/belgian-built-gbif-alert-system-wins-the-2023-ebbe-nielsen-challenge#gbifalert).  
It is an open-source GBIF-based alert system for occurrences which will notify users of newly available occurrence records for any species or location of interest.
For more information, links and a demo video, follow this [link](https://www.gbif.org/news/EQgUzZ4YA75BSeLs1naI9/belgian-built-gbif-alert-system-wins-the-2023-ebbe-nielsen-challenge#gbifalert).  

[**David Shorthouse**](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7618-5230) was awarded second place for the 2023 Ebbe Nielsen challenge for a new feature in [**Bionomia**](https://bionomia.net/), a platform he developed and launched five years ago.
[**Frictionless Data from Bionomia**](https://www.gbif.org/news/EQgUzZ4YA75BSeLs1naI9/belgian-built-gbif-alert-system-wins-the-2023-ebbe-nielsen-challenge#bionomia) allows users to automatically have access to [Frictionless Data Packages](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-package/) of collector and identifier attributions in Bionomia for every dataset.
This will help collections manager to import Bionomia attributions into a local collection management system and share newly updated and improved records, creating a virtuous "round trip" cycle of data quality improvements.

It would be unfair to not talk about the other individuals and teams that have seen their projects awarded with a tied third prize in the challenge:
 - [**Library of Identification Resources**](https://www.gbif.org/news/EQgUzZ4YA75BSeLs1naI9/belgian-built-gbif-alert-system-wins-the-2023-ebbe-nielsen-challenge#lir), developed by [**Lars Willighagen**](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4751-4637), a master student at the [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/en) (Netherlands)
 - [**Open Data Biodiversity Mapper**](https://www.gbif.org/news/EQgUzZ4YA75BSeLs1naI9/belgian-built-gbif-alert-system-wins-the-2023-ebbe-nielsen-challenge#odbm), developed by a Norvegian team composed of [**Sam Wenaas Perrin**](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1266-1573), [**Philip Stanley Mostert**](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/philip.s.mostert) and [**Ron Togunov**](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/ron.togunov), all three from the [Norwegian University of Science and Technology](https://www.ntnu.edu/)
 
 A big round of applause to all of them!
 
 The [**Ebbe Nielsen challenge**](https://www.gbif.org/ebbe) is an annual incentive prize that seeks to inspire innovative applications of open-access biodiversity data by scientists, informaticians, data modelers, cartographers and other experts.
