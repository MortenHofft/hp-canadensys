The *Society for the Preservation of Natural History Collections (SPNHC)* & *Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG)* joint conference in 2024 will be a hybrid meeting, hosted in **Okinawa, Japan from 2 - 6, September 2024**.  
Be there in person or online!  

We invite you to [**submit a proposal for an organized session at SPNHC-TDWG 2024**](https://mailchi.mp/tdwg.org/spnhc-tdwg-2024-okinawa-call-for-organized-sessions) that reflects the work that SPNHC and TDWG do and the ways that collections and standards contribute to our understanding and documentation of biodiversity. Organized sessions can be symposia, panel discussions, lightning sessions, and other formats in which the primary purpose is to convey information and engage the SPNHC-TDWG audience.  

**Submission (hard) deadline:  16 February 2024** (Close of Business in your time zone). Essential early information has been posted on the [*SPNHC-TDWG 2024 conference website*](https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2024/). Additional information will be posted as it becomes available.  

We strongly encourage you to submit proposals that fit the conference theme: **Enhancing Local Capacity, Elevating Global Standards**. Sessions may be open or closed to presentation submissions; we highly encourage diversity and inclusivity and session ideas not explored during previous SPNHC or TDWG conferences.  
Calls for abstracts will be announced in early March, 2024.
