The GBIF Secretariat has announced a process for reviewing the data schema underlying the [Global Registry of Scientific Collections](https://scientific-collections.gbif.org/)(GRSciColl). Community members are encouraged to share their feedback, suggestions and observations now through **Friday, 22 December 2023**.  

The overarching goal of this review is ensure that the GRSciColl data schema accommodates multiple data sources within a standardized vocabulary that is both intuitive and well-documented. Comments are welcome regarding all fields in the schema for institutions, collections and contacts.  

GRSciColl aims to provide vital information about physical scientific collections, encompassing details that include:  

* the contents of collections
* their geographic locations
* contacts
* associated institutions
* associated codes and identifiers
* GRSciColl also helps ensure data integrity and accessibility in its role as a reference for institution and collection codes and identifiers.  

# How to participate
We invite all members of the scientific community to lend their voices and contribute to this review. To provide feedback, kindly follow these steps:

1. **Read the [2023-2024 road map](https://scientific-collections.gbif.org/road-map)** for context on GRSciColl's proposed path and goals.
2. **Fill out any or all of the three forms** focused on GRSciColl's three main content types:
	* [Collections](https://forms.gle/F4Skj3F3jJqoUqmM9)
	* [Institutions](https://forms.gle/phBMM285zuvJ5ehP7)
	* [Contact and identifiers](https://forms.gle/SGjqHynoHcxZEm9n6)


# Stay informed

For those keen on staying updated and actively participating in shaping the future of information about scientific collections, here are a few key avenues:
