## Canadensys

Biological collections are replete with taxonomic, geographic, temporal, numerical, and historical information. This information is crucial for understanding and properly managing biodiversity and ecosystems, but is often difficult to access. Canadensys, operated from the [Université de Montréal Biodiversity Centre](https://irbv.umontreal.ca/institute/infrastructure/biodiversity-centre/?lang=en), is a Canada-wide effort to make the biodiversity information held in biological collections accessible to everyone.

Canadensys publishes specimen data from Canadian natural history collections, as well as other kinds of biodiversity data such as species checklists, many of which include estimates of species richness. Some of these resources include data on species new to science. Canadensys also hosts the data publication platforms for two online taxonomic journals, [Specimen](https://specimenpub.org/) and [Collection](https://specimenpub.org/).

Our goal is to [digitize], [publish] and [georeference] data compatible with the [Canadian Biodiversity Information Facility (CBIF)] and the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)]. Collection managers openly publish their data as [Darwin Core], an internationally-accepted [biodiversity information standard]. A [dynamic, central web portal] allows access to the network’s specimen data (including images and geospatial information) as well as searchable checklists of up-to-date scientific names from the [Database of Canadian Vascular Plants (VASCAN)].

By enabling the publication of these data, Canadensys facilitates cross-analyses of species occurrence data within geospatial and environmental models. This enhances both our understanding of global environmental issues and the development of sound biodiversity policies across the country.
