# Introduction

This guide explains how to publish your biodiversity data to [GBIF](http://www.gbif.org/) and the world using the [Canadensys repository](http://data.canadensys.net/ipt). It is not the only method you can use to publish your data, but we think it is presently the most convenient one for Canadian collections and organizations.
Our repository is powered by the [GBIF Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT)](https://www.gbif.org/en/ipt) and maintained by us, which allows you to upload, standardize, publish and register your data in **7 steps**, without the hassle of installing and maintaining a program. The data are published in your organizationâ€™s name and it is free.
