Data publication is the process of making biodiversity information available online, and is the core mission of Canadensys.  

To publish data on Canadensys and GBIF, several crucial steps are recommended. [Data cleaning](/resources/documents/#data-cleaning), [standardization](/fr/resources/documents/#data-standardization-and-darwin-core) and [georeferencing](/resources/documents/#georeferencing) are needed to make data compatible with international databases. Although not mandatory, [imaging](resources/documents/#digitization-imaging) of labels or specimens is also often part of the data publication process. More detailed information and best practices for all these steps are provided on the [Resources pages](/resources/documents/) of this portal. 

Once the data have been cleaned, standardized and georeferenced, they are ready for publication. The process for publishing data on the Canadensys repository is explained in our [7-step guide](/publish/7-step-guide) to data publication.
